Although this simple program asks us to simply fix a bug by changing an
addition symbol (+) to a multiplier symbol (\*) to get the correct amount to bill
doris, lane points out the go build program, which allows us to compile the
executable:

```bash
go build fix_a_bug.go
```

Which will build the executable by that same name, thusly invoking:

```bash
./fix_a_bug
```

Will yield us our print to the console.

## Getting Started

**Enable dependency tracking for your code**

```bash
go mod init example/hello
# go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello
```

Once you have written your hello_world.go program, you can compile/execute it:

```bash
go run .
# Hello, World!
```

If you need help:

```bash
go help
```
